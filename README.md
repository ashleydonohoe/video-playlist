# Video-playlist
This is a basic webpage that lets users select beach videos from a list and loads them in an HTML player using JavaScript

This is a work in progress and primarily for experimentation with HTML5 media players and JavaScript. Planned features include:
- Captions
- Custom media player skin 
- Scrolling playlist
- Additional videos
- Video information shown during playback
